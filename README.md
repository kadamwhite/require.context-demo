# `require.context` demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Look at the code in [index.js](./src/index.js) to see how you can use [`require.context`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#requirecontext) to load and render multiple SVG files without manually listing them out one by one. It's not 100% clear to me how this sort of logic would behave in the context of a React app running within WordPress, but hopefully it'll get you started.
